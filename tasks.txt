TASKS FOR WEBSITE

- Populate Experiences and projects with rich descriptions, Portfolio Items, and photos (Come up with a general scheme?)
- Add an "Other Projects" option on the dropdown for non-professional additions to the portfolio (Midd stuff, etc.)
- Update Actual C.V.!
- Add a page for your Music - this comes later.
- General website files org - folder structure and internal structure.
- Ensure components of HTML that need to be generally applicable are consistent - is there a way to package these up?
