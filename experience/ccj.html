        <h2>My Work at Center For Coalfield Justice (CCJ)</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Center for Coalfield Justice</strong> (CCJ) is an environmental justice nonprofit focused on advocacy, education, and organizing in Southwestern Pennsylvania.
            CCJ primarily operates in Washington County and Greene County, my home county. I first became interested in working on environmental issues when the land behind my home fell into the path of a natural gas pipeline. 
            A fifty-foot wide and roughly quarter-mile long stretch of trees were clear cut, and I was left wondering about the human levers, decisions, and power structures involved in decimating a whole lot of life that was special to me. 
            As such, CCJ was a logical first step in my career, where I could work on issues I knew about for people and a place that I care about! 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>- Discussing sensitive topics around fossil fuel development with impacted residents.</li>
            <li>- Navigating municipal structures, and politely expecting accountability from those with power.</li>
            <li>- Developing the soft skills necessary for community organizing.</li>
