        <h2>My Work at The Nature Conservancy</h2>
        <p>
            The summer after graduating from Middlebury, I completed an internship with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)'s Tri-State Chapter (MN, ND, SD). My title was <strong>Resilient Waters Intern</strong>, and I worked across projects
            for the Chapter's Resilient Waters team.  
        </p>

        <h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Prairie Plant Surveys</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Peatland Carbon Flux Monitoring</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Wild Rice (Manoomin) Monitoring</strong></li>
            <li><strong>GIS Data Management</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Prairie Stream Assessment and Strategy Prioritization</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges & What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my time at TNC, I encountered unique challenges, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Creating Cartograpic products for project stakeholder meetings.</li>
            <li>- Learning and implementing complex field protocols for stream surveys, plant surveys, and peatland research.</li>
            <li>- Data analysis for Plant community surveys in R.</li>
            <li>- working with a host of diffent voices, stakeholders, and interest groups on projects, including multiple indigenous tribes leading conservation projects.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Fieldwork</h3>
        <p>
            TNC's peatland research required that we go out into the Sax-Zim Bog of Nothern MN, in order to measure peat depth, water level, plant diversity, and carbon flux. This was my favorite fieldwork of the summer, despite the 
            thick swarms of mosquitoes and unique scent of methane that can come off of the bog.

                It not only damaged the connectivity of the bog ecosystem, but also tended to fail miserably.</p>

        <p>
            We also monitored wild rice extent and health as part of a project led by Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources and a coalition of indigenous tribes. The rice primarily grows in MN's uniquely shallow lakes, many of which
            have been cleared for recreation purposes. Not only is the Wild Rice totally delicious, its of massive cultural significance to the tribes and a critical component of MN's lake ecosystems. I feel super lucky that I got the chance
            to learn about it from folks who have harvested it since time immemorial.

                paddling and balancing yourself to complete protocols.

            One of the bigger field projects we undertook was asessing a few miles of Mud Creek, a praire stream in central MN, and developing a conservation strategy and prioritization report including our findings and all other available asessments of the reach.
            We assessed channel and bank erosion, and made detailed notes on biota, vegetation, and riparian conditions.
