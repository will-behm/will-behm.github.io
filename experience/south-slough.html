        <h2>My Work at South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve</h2>
        <p>
            Sough Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR) is one of NOAA's thirty
            <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/" target="_blank">National Estuarine Research Reserves</a> across the
            United States. They were established by the Coastal Zone Safety Act to study estuarine systems, with an emphasis on community
            collaboration and service. As GIS Intern, I completed an <strong>independent research project</strong>, advised by SSNERR's GIS Specialist,
            and completed <strong>field research</strong> across SSNERR's ongoing projects, including sea level rise monitoring, water quality monitoring, Eelgrass restoration, salt marsh research, RTK data collection, 
            leveling elevation surveys, and more. 
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges & What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my time at South Slough, I encountered unique challenges, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Completing a research project from start to finish, including formal documentation and presentation.</li>
            <li>- Balancing office work with a heavy fieldwork schedule.</li>
            <li>- Learning when to ask effective questions, and when to find answers for myself.</li>
            <li>- Learning new and complicated field protocols quickly, and remaining detail oriented in adverse field conditions.</li>
            <li>- Getting stuck up to my waist in mud.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Independent Research Project</h3>
        <p>
            My project was called  <strong>Understanding Changes in the Extent of Metcalf Marsh through Analysis of Historic Aerial Imagery</strong>.
            When I began my internship I had never used ArcGIS Pro, or worked with imagery analysis. However, I had some background from open-source GIS coursework at Middlebury, and jumped right into
            as many tutorials as I could get my hands on. With lots of great guidance from SSNERR's GIS Specialist, I developed a workflow to georeference the old images, segment them, then perform a change detection analysis.
            I did a formal write-up for the project, and presented it to the entire reserve staff.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work yielded some very interesting results despite it's challenges and shortcomings. While the quality and quantity of older aerial images was difficult to work with,
            I still found that the addition of a dike (assumed to have occurred in the years preceding my earliest image) had impacts on marsh extent and forest edge, presumably due to a lack of tidal inundation.
            Check out the full report below for more interesting bits like that! If I was digging back into a proect like this today, I would be intersted to look into larger quantities of more recent imagery,
            where i could more accurately discern changes in marsh extent, and handle differences in periodic tidal inundation status across images. Overall, this was a super immersive and exciting way to learn ArcGIS Pro,
            and it felt good to leave behind a workflow that might be useful to someone else looking into SSNERR's archive of historic images!

        <h3>Field Research</h3>
        <p>
            While not working on my independent research, I was in the field learning new protocols, and carrying out routine monitoring and research across the ongoing projects at SSNERR.
            At a high level, I got really familiar with the process of learning new methods and protocols. Most of the time, I learned the procedures I had to correctly implement on the fly. We verified geographic benchmarks
            all around the reserve with RTK equipment, sometimes doing static surveys, and sometimes using a rover. I was amazed by the level of precision their survey equipment could achieve, and really felt like I got a look into
            the care that goes into long term monitoring over many years.

        I also got to support the work of the other interns as needed, most notably taking soil cores along sediment gradients in the estuary. Diminishing degrees of tidal inundation, salinity, and physical conditions (from waves/current)
        occur as you travel inland from the mouth of the estuary, up into what eventually are entirely freshwater streams. This is reflected to an astounding extent in soil characteristics, and ultimately plant communities.

            This is just a small portion of the fieldwork I completed over the summer! I also got to be involved with eelgrass and salt marsh monitoring, vegetation biomonitoring, changing and offloading data from water quality sondes,
            and invasive species management!
