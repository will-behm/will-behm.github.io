        <h2>My Work at South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve</h2>
        <p>
            Sough Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve (SSNERR) is one of NOAA's thirty
            <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/nerrs/" target="_blank">National Estuarine Research Reserves</a> across the
            United States. They were established by the Coastal Zone Safety Act to study estuarine systems, with an emphasis on community
            collaboration and service. As GIS Intern, I completed an <strong>independent research project</strong>, advised by SSNERR's GIS Specialist,
            and completed <strong>field research</strong> across SSNERR's ongoing projects, including sea level rise monitoring, water quality monitoring, Eelgrass restoration, salt marsh research, RTK data collection, 
            leveling elevation surveys, and more. 
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges & What I Learned</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout my time at South Slough, I encountered unique challenges, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- Handling multiple complex projects simultaneously.</li>
            <li>- Collaborating closely with an extremely small team (IE, Being scrappy, and wearing many hats).</li>
            <li>- Independently learning Python to wrangle a wide array of data types and sources, creating individualized products for 13 organic farms.</li>
            <li>- Working and communicating with a team of highly skilled environmental modelers and programmers, learning from them, and discussing the implications of their work with farmers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Independent Research Project</h3>
        <p>
            My project was called  <strong>Understanding Changes in the Extent of Metcalf Marsh through Analysis of Historic Aerial Imagery</strong>.
            When I began my internship I had never used ArcGIS Pro, or worked with imagery analysis. However, I had some background from open-source GIS coursework at Middlebury, and jumped right into
            as many tutorials as I could get my hands on. With lots of great guidance from SSNERR's GIS Specialist, I developed a workflow to georeference the old images, segment them, then perform a change detection analysis.
            I did a formal write-up for the project, and presented it to the entire reserve staff.
        </p>

        <p>
            My work yielded some very interesting results despite it's challenges and shortcomings. While the quality and quantity of older aerial images was difficult to work with,
            I still found that the addition of a dike (assumed to have occurred in the years preceding my earliest image) had impacts on marsh extent and forest edge, presumably due to a lack of tidal inundation.
            Check out the full report below for more interesting bits like that! If I was digging back into a proect like this today, I would be intersted to look into larger quantities of more recent imagery,
            where i could more accurately discern changes in marsh extent, and handle differences in periodic tidal inundation status across images. Overall, this was a super immersive and exciting way to learn ArcGIS Pro,
            and it felt good to leave behind a workflow that might be useful to someone else looking into SSNERR's archive of historic images!
