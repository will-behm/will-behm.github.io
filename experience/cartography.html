        <h2>Some projects with cool visualizations</h2>
        <p>
            I've always enjoyed getting nitty gritty on maps and visualizations when given the change - its a real challenge to establish an appropriate visual hierarchy, and make a map truly readable.
            To me, the best maps can communicate exactly what they mean to without needing to be "read". Maps can be astoundingly intuitive, but it takes a keen eye and real nuance (both of which I am still chasing) to
            make them so.

        <h3>Monochrome Map</h3>
        <p>
            I made this map in my Cartography class at Middlebury - the challenge issued to us was to pretend we only had one pen of a single color, and to develop a taxonomy based on texture, stroke, and value.
            I was fresh off of my internship with South Slough NERR, and leaned into my excitement about estuaries and intertidal wetlands. I can remember being particularly excited about the offshore orientation of this map. It reminds me of how over that summer, my perspective of the estuary shifted 
            as I spent time working in it, and traveling by boat. I began visualizing it more like this, as opposed to picturing what it looked like from the shore. The taxonomy sheet gives a deeper look into how I established all of the variables on the map. My one regret with this one is that I didn't make the wetlands
            stand out more. Apologies for the weird borders! These didn't convert well and I hope to fix it soon.
        </p>

        <h3>Multivariate Map</h3>
        <p>
            I was pretty obsessed with Billy Strings in college, being the flatpicker that I am. I'm not sure I'm still at "make a map about him" - level fervor these days, but I
            certainly still love his music despite my further ramblings down bluegrass rabbit holes. Another one of our challenges in my cartography class was to make a map emphasizing multiple variables. 
            I chose to look at which states Billy Strings played shows in (elevated), which he didnt (in shadow), what order he played the dates in (the numbering), and a continuous representation of time across them (the coloring, and the shadows where the line crosses over itself).
            Really, my hope was to make it look like the line was deeper into the map on the later dates, but that effect didnt come out so well. Anyhow, it was super fun to pull together the dataset and figure out how to make all of the effects! You may need to zoom in to see the names clearly - small image for website purposes!
