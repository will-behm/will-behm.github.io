Github Pages portfolio site

## What I'm working on
There are so many ways I want to make this site cooler than it is. Here are some of them, mostly for me. If you're a person who isn't me and you're reading this, I applaude your thorough search of my online presence.

- Update C.V.
- Add more recent photos, especially on the home page. 
- Condense internship-type experiences into a nested dropdown (internship page with panels)
    - maybe make this a page to talk about Midd a bit?
- Add a page for UVM research
- Design overhaul - What are the limits of Github pages? 
    - I think I could shift this to a project-level site, so that I could make a website for other repos in the future.
