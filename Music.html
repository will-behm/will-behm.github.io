        <p>I started my bluegrass band, Otter Creek, almost four years ago as a senior at Middlebury College, and with the help of my bandmates have grown it into an act that regularly performs around New England. I've played guitar since I was 12, and am obsessed with developing a nuanced, yet authentic sound that is grounded in good technique, strong theory chops, and tradition.
            Moreover, I absolutely love getting to know folks that care about traditional music - the best part about playing music is connecting with other people!
